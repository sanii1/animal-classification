#  Animal Classification Using Deep Learning

This project classifies animal images into predefined categories using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Built as part of my Machine Learning internship to gain hands-on experience with computer vision tasks.

##  Problem Statement
Classify images of animals such as cats, dogs, birds, and bears using a supervised learning approach.

##  Objectives
- Build a CNN-based classifier for animals
- Train using image datasets and improve generalization
- Evaluate model accuracy and prediction quality

##  Dataset
- Images of cats, dogs, birds, and bears
- Preprocessing: Resizing, normalization, augmentation
- Split: 80% training / 20% testing

##  Tools & Libraries
- Python  
- TensorFlow, Keras  
- NumPy, OpenCV  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

##  Model Performance
- **Training Accuracy**: ~98%  
- **Testing Accuracy**: ~88%  
- Evaluation: Accuracy curve, Confusion matrix

##  Visuals
- Sample predictions  
- Training vs validation accuracy  
- Class distribution bar plot

##  Future Work
- Real-time webcam prediction  
- Extend to more animal classes  
- Try transfer learning (ResNet, VGG)
